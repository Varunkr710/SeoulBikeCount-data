To predict bike rental counts and assist in decision-making, we developed a machine learning model that incorporates key variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
This model effectively predicts bike rental demand under various conditions, allowing the business to anticipate changes and optimize operations accordingly. 
By leveraging this model, the business can implement targeted strategies to increase bike rentals,
such as promoting rentals during favorable weather conditions or adjusting operational hours based on temperature trends.
